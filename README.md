Code Decisions:
- I choose not optimized function as mail suggest to focus on the code quality than Algorithm.
- There is a optimized algo for matrix mul called Strassens Algo
    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strassens-matrix-multiplication/
- To write unit test, I tried to use Googletest for unit-test but Macbook is new for me so It took sometime to setup it up. 

How to run the code:
- Download this code
- run "make" command
- execute ./exe
